Published in: Realized Cryptocurrencies Volatility Forecasting with Jumps

Description: In this paper, to investigate the realized volatility of the highly volatile cryptocurrencies asset, we employ threhold realized variance method to separate jump component apart from continuous process. Despite that the jump process doesnâ€™t improve explanation power, we can still find that jump brings information. The one-day lagged threshold jump component has significant positive impact on the future realized volatility, this suggest that we are likely to find cryptocurrency market more volatile after jumps happened one day before. However, the un-threshold jump component is negatively correlated to the future realized volatility significantly.
